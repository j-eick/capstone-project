# Hello and welcome to RunGraph 🏃🏃🏼‍♀️

### 💭 Backstory
After a calve injury in 2015 the wound reopened a few times because of wrong treatment and insuffient recovery. It took me around 6 years to stabilize my calve to a point where I can run again without having to worry too much about literally running into the next injury. Until I got to this point I started my runs extremely carefully, by walking 100m, then slowly jogging 100m, then walking again and so on. <br> 
The pain in my calve had become quite characteristic and I knew what feeling I had to pay attention to in order to cancel the activity and be more careful overall. I wanted to keep track of my past runs to observe my overall progress and started a protocol with what distance at what intensity caused my xy amount of pain. <br>
Fast forward a few months and the idea to create RunGraph was born.<br><br>

**RunGraph** visualises run data by turning it into a diagram. Enter your _distance_, _time_, _pace_, _intensity_, optional _pain level_ and get a quick impression of your progress.
Aside from visualising your past runs, RunGraph aims to inform you about your workouts, PBs and some more. Hence this project is gradually evolving.
